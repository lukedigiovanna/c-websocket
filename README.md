# C-WebSocket

Rudimentary implementation of the WebSocket protocol in C.

Also necessarily implementes HTTP 1.1 to build the WebSocket protocol on top of.

Read about implementing a WebSocket server from scratch in my article:

[Implementing a WebSocket Server in C](https://lukedigiovanna.github.io/writings/implementing-a-websocket-server-in-c/)

## Building

This server is developed for Linux and MacOS.

Run the `make` in `src` to get the `server` executable for the demo.
